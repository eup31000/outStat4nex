# outStat4Nex

outStat4Nex is a Python script for extracting information from a Nexus .out file into Excel

## Usage

```Command line
>outStat <myNexusCase.out>
```
Will generate a myNexusCase_stat.xlsx file in the same folder as .out file

## Limitations
Version 1.0 will only work with .out files generated with Nexus 4.12 or 4.13 release, not tested for previous versions.
For future versions, code might break if simulator changes the format of the well summary reports in the .out file.
